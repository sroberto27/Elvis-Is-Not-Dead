# Elvis-Is-Not-Dead
Elvis did not die; HE was abducted! After waking up from cryogenesis, Elvis escaped from his alien captors. He has to run through a relentless desert, avoiding a series of obstacles, and take every opportunity to take advantage of their captors. Elvis embarks on this race to Las Vegas that seems like there is no end. Will you help the king to go back to glory?
